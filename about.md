## About Me
I earned my BSc in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Istanbul University in 2019 and started an MSc in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at Yildiz Technical University, where I completed all coursework with a focus on embedded systems and telecommunications. My thesis is on hold due to relocation abroad.

I have been passionate about electronics and computers since my early years. Over time, I have gained hands-on experience with MCUs, SoCs, and embedded platforms, working across automotive, railway, and consumer electronics projects. Iâ€™ve developed embedded software using bare-metal, RTOS, and Embedded Linux approaches, and worked with industry standards such as ASPICE, IEC Class B, and ASIL D. My expertise spans from low-level driver development and hardware bring-up to system integration and test automation.

I am particularly interested in FPGA-based systems, real-time video processing, and HW-SW co-design, applying CI/CD and DevOps practices to embedded workflows.

Beyond technology, I enjoy maker projects, Raspberry Pi tinkering, and open-source contributions.

Thatâ€™s why I consider myself an Embedded Software & Systems Engineer with an end-to-end perspective.
